# Smart Parking using Raspberry Pi and Arduino

A parking space consists of two LEDs and a servo motor and a car presence sensor. The servo motor is used to block the parking space when it is not reserved and when the person who has reserved has not yet activated his space. The LEDs indicate the status of the parking space (taken, reserved, occupied, free).

#### Purpose
To create an intelligent parking. To simplify, you will have two parking spaces to manage.

#### Language
Implementation in Python with Raspberry Pi 4
